				- The colors are too strong<br>
				- It is very hard to read<br>
				- The pink text and color on top of the black is not pleasing to the eye<br>
				- The pictures could be used a lot better<br>
				- The buttons are not easy to read<br>
				- This page needs to be re done ASAP!</br>

				- The type could be worked a lot more, the texts have different weights which could be hard to notice the difference in the importance of it.<br>
				- The photography could be worked a to more and it could be incorporated in a better way, it is the importance of the company </br>
				but it is not shown very well on your website.<br>
				- The text is very tight very hard to read. Also having half white text and half black just makes a big jump for the eyes and it can be 
   				uncomfortable to read.</br>
				- There are some errors on spelling, well more just capitals and things like that.<br>
				- The info about hours and phone number are usually at the bottom of the page, in this case is on the top right and its distracting</br>
				- The information on the page could be minimized and/ or better organized<br>
				- The columns that are formed on the white box could be simplify a lot. They could be separated and the stay connected could just</br>
   				be the simble and have a link to open a new tab for each page. Also have all the buttons for each page like Facebook and youtube be the same color</br>
				- Everyone must know what SeaBird is if they are going on the page, so the background is very unnecessary. <br>
				- The logos could be placed and used better,and the one that is on the bottom looks very weird with the white box around it.</br>
